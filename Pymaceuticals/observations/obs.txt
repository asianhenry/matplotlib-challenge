Observations and Insights

From just a general overview of the data analysis, we can see that out of all the treatments,
there were only two treatments that showed promising results: Ramicane and Capomulin. From the summary
statistics, those two treatments were the only ones with mean and median tumor volumes below the initial
tumor volumes. Perhaps a better representation are the box plots of final tumor volumes showing those
two treatments trending below the initial tumor volume of each mouse.

We can also look more closely at data for mice treated with the Capomulin regimen, and see that it is
indeed a promising treatment showing good results for tumor reduction. While the data analysis only shows 
the line plot for one specific mouse treated with the Capomulin regimen, when changing the observed mouse 
and briefly looking at the line plots for different mice treated with Capomulin, we can see that each mouse 
shows a general downward trend of the tumor volume.

Lastly the linear regression analysis of Average Tumor Volume vs Mouse Weight for the Capomulin Regimen shows
a decently strong linear trend between the two variables; correlation coefficient is 0.842. Since the initial
tumor volumes were constant for each mouse, this perhaps suggests that a larger dose or some other variable change 
in treatment is required for larger or heavier mice (eventually people) to effectively reduce tumor volume.
